## How to use

### Call modes

#### Call Command mode

*(Make a call)*

* To make a call:
  1. Call to your Twilio number, from one of [`CALL_COMMAND_PHONE_NUMBER`](#call_command_phone_number).
  2. In the call, you can dial the number.
  3. In the call, a new call will be made with your Twilio number, to the dialed number.

#### Call Forwarding mode

*(Receive a call)*

* Calls to your Twilio number will be forwarded to the desired number:
  * If the call is from the US number, it will be forwarded to [`CALL_RECEIVE_US_PHONE_NUMBER`](#call_receive_us_phone_number).
  * Otherwise, it will be forwarded to [`CALL_RECEIVE_INTL_PHONE_NUMBER`](#call_receive_intl_phone_number).
  * Exceptions: the calls from the numbers in [`CALL_COMMAND_PHONE_NUMBER`](#call_command_phone_number) will be routed to the [Call Command mode](#call-command-mode).
* [Call Alert](#call-alert) will be sent to your Twilio number, simultaneously.

#### Call Alert

*(Alert the call: incoming call and missed call)*

* **With the call forwarding,** Call Alert will be sent to your Twilio number.
  * If you have multiple Twilio numbers, this will help you identify the number which has the call.
  * The message for incoming call looks like below:

    ```plain
    Incoming call: +12120007890 (US)
    Name: KIM,JONGMIN
    Carrier: T-Mobile USA, Inc. (mobile)
    ```

    * You can control the information included in the message:
      * [`CALL_SHOW_CARRIER`](#call_show_carrier) controls the carrier lookup (0.005 USD per a call, billed by Twilio)

        ```plain
        Incoming call: +12120007890 (US)
        Carrier: T-Mobile USA, Inc. (mobile)
        ```

        ```plain
        Incoming call: +12120007890 (US)
        Name: KIM,JONGMIN
        ```

      * If both flags disabled, the message would be like below:

        ```plain
        Incoming call: +12120007890 (US)
        ```

* **When you missed the call,** Call Alert will be sent to your email [`CALL_ALERT_TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS`](#call_alert_to_email_address).
